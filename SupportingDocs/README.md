# SupportingDocs

*The following is copy/pasted from the root's README.md file.*
*It broadly encapsulates the contents of this folder.*

Aside from a couple of files resting in the top layer of this directory, most folders contain the following structure:

* `01_Raw/` - data that is taken directly from a publicly available source.
* `02_Wrangled/` - usually the result of wrangling raw data, but not formatted perfectly for the process. Intermediary location for data.
* `03_Complete/` - data that is ready to be incorporated for either:
    * a.) direct use in the process functions
    * b.) directly setting up one of the tables used in the simulation (ie: HousingLookup)

There may be some exceptions to this rule as the structure of this project has matured throughout the duration of the project.
But generally, it should fit this structure.

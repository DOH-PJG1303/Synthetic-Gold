# Testing

*The following is copy/pasted from the root's README.md file.*

This is just a space to check out the outputs of the Initialization files and the simulation data.
Treat this as a jumping-off point for your own validation and testing of the process.
This project was created by one person and very well may have hiccups.
If you find any, please fix them yourself or contact PJ, who's contact rests at the bottom of this README.md file.

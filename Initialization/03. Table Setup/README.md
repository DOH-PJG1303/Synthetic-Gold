# Table Setup

This folder is designed to setup the population and all supporting tables for the year 1920.
When we start the simulation, we retrace all individuals to 1890 and run the simulation so that families can form and people can populate housing units by 1920.

# START HERE - User Instructions

1. *Databricks* - You can run the files *01. SSNPool.py*, *02. Create Fname Lookup.py*, and *03. Create Lname Lookup.py* at the same time.  None are dependent on one another.  Please wait until all scripts have completed successfully before proceeding. Note that the SSNPool script is rather computationally intensive, so it can take up to 2 hours to complete.

2. *Databricks* - Navigate to *04. Births Table - Grandparent Generation.py*.  Run script and wait for completion.

3. *Databricks* - Navigate to *05. Population Table - Grandparent Generation.py*.  **FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN BEGINNING MARKDOWN OF SCRIPT**. THEN run script and wait for completion.

4. *Databricks* - You can run 06. PhoneLookup Table.py* and *07. AdjectiveLookup.py* at the same time.  Please wait until all scripts have completed successfully before proceeding.

7. *Databricks* - Navigate to *08. Initialize Tables.py*.  Run script and wait for completion.

Congratulations!!
You did it.
Next step is running the simulation.  That part will take a while.
